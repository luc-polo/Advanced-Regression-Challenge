# Advanced Regression Challenge

### Purpose and Scope:
The goal of this academic project, part of my Advanced Regression course, was to develop the best linear regression model for a given dataset. The dataset contained 100 samples and 200 features, and the challenge was evaluated based on performance in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). To achieve this, various linear regression methods were implemented, along with feature engineering and selection techniques.

### Results:
I ranked 1st out of the 80 students in my cohort, including the teacher! (Email from the teacher enclosed as proof of this result)

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Data visualization and statistical summaries**:
  - Analysis of predictors and target variables
  - Correlation between features and target variable
- **Regression Techniques**:
  - Classical Linear Regression
  - Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)
  - Lasso and ElasticNet regression with parameter optimization
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Creation and evaluation of quadratic and non-quadratic features
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
  - Cross-validation with stratified splitting of the target variable into bins for balanced representation across folds.
  - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and robustness

### Repository Structure:
- **Script.ipynb**: The Python notebook containing the complete implementation of regression analysis, including data preprocessing, visualization, modeling, and evaluation steps.
- **requirements.txt**: A file listing all the dependencies (packages and versions) required to run the project
- **Assignement.pdf**: The challenge assignment document detailing the task requirements and providing information about the datasets
- **my_predictions.txt**: The final predictions made on Xtest.txt, used for evaluation in the challenge
- **data.txt**: The full dataset provided for model development, containing both predictors and the corresponding target values
- **Xtest.txt**: The dataset containing only predictors, used for generating final predictions to be evaluated as part of the challenge
  

### How to execute the code?
The Jupyter Notebook contains all the necessary code, visualizations, and outputs. You can view it directly on GitHub without running the code manually. However, if you want to run the notebook locally, all the requirements are provided.
